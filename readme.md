## FAQ

__buckets don't work(place liquid) when used.__   
just use the node form of it. use default:water_source instead of bucket:bucket_water

__how do I use this mod for random liquid__  
simple, add random liquids mod to the depends.txt file,
and the modname:node_name to to the liquid_list.
if it has a bucket form, add its bucket:node_name to 
liquid_bucket_list
